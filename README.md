## Core Concepts

### Microservices Overview

*   **AccountService:** Manages all aspects of user accounts, including registration, secure login (JWT generation), user profile information, multi-currency wallet balances, and handling (mock) deposit/withdrawal transactions. It interacts directly with its dedicated PostgreSQL database.
*   **ExchangeService:** Responsible for fetching (mock) real-time exchange rates from configured external APIs. It processes currency conversion and mock trading requests, interacting with `AccountService` asynchronously via RabbitMQ for critical balance checks and final wallet updates. It also has its own PostgreSQL database for storing trade-related data.
*   **APIGateway (Spring Cloud Gateway):** Serves as the single entry point for all client requests. It handles dynamic routing to appropriate backend microservices (discovered via Eureka), performs centralized security checks (JWT validation), and manipulates request headers (e.g., adding the `X-User` header after URL-encoding the username extracted from the JWT).
*   **Eureka Server:** Provides service discovery capabilities, allowing microservices to register themselves and enabling the API Gateway and other services to dynamically locate instances of required services.
*   **RabbitMQ:** Facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices, particularly for operations that can be decoupled to improve user experience and system resilience, such as post-trade wallet updates or pre-trade balance verifications.

### Security Flow & Header Decoding

1.  User registers or logs in through endpoints routed via the API Gateway to `AccountService`.
2.  `AccountService` validates credentials and, upon successful authentication, generates a JWT. This JWT is then set as an `HttpOnly` and `Secure` (in production) cookie in the HTTP response.
3.  For subsequent requests to protected API endpoints:
    *   The browser automatically includes the JWT cookie with the request.
    *   The API Gateway intercepts the request. Its `JwtTokenValidator` component validates the JWT.
    *   If valid, the `JwtCookieToHeaderFilter` (in API Gateway) extracts the username (subject) from the JWT, **URL-encodes** it, and adds it as an `X-User` header to the request.
    *   The request, now with the `X-User` header, is forwarded to the appropriate backend microservice.
    *   In the backend service, a custom `DecodingUserHeaderFilter` (a `jakarta.servlet.Filter`) intercepts the incoming request.
    *   This filter specifically looks for the `X-User` header, **URL-decodes** its value (e.g., `%C5%9Fefik` becomes `ÅŸefik`), and wraps the original `HttpServletRequest` to provide the decoded username.
    *   The controller's `@RequestHeader("X-User") String username` parameter then receives the correctly decoded username.

### Asynchronous Processing with RabbitMQ

*   **Trade Execution:** When a user initiates an exchange in `ExchangeService`, it publishes messages to RabbitMQ queues for tasks like balance verification and wallet updates.
*   **Decoupled Consumers:** `AccountService` listens to these queues and processes these tasks asynchronously.
*   **Benefits:** Improves `ExchangeService` responsiveness, enhances system resilience, and reduces direct inter-service dependencies.

## Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
*   Apache Maven 3.6.x or later
*   Docker Engine and Docker Compose
*   Node.js (v18+) and npm/yarn (for frontend development if running locally)
*   An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code)

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/engineerdavut/currency-exchange-platform.git
    cd currency-exchange-platform
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Navigate to the `docker/` directory.
    *   Create a `.env` file (you can copy `.env.example` if it exists or create a new one).
    *   Populate it with your configurations (see `docker-compose.yml` for required variables):
        ```dotenv
        # Example .env content:
        ACCOUNT_POSTGRES_USER=your_user
        ACCOUNT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
        ACCOUNT_POSTGRES_DB=account_db
        EXCHANGE_POSTGRES_USER=your_user
        EXCHANGE_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
        EXCHANGE_POSTGRES_DB=exchange_db
        RABBITMQ_HOST=rabbitmq
        RABBITMQ_PORT=5672
        RABBITMQ_USER=guest
        RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=guest
        EUREKA_URI=http://eureka-server:8761/eureka
        JWT_SECRET=YourSuperStrongAndLongSecretKeyForJWT-AtLeast32Bytes
        JWT_EXPIRATION=3600000
        EXCHANGE_API_LAYER_KEY=YourApiLayerKey
        EXCHANGE_EXCHANGERATE_KEY=YourExchangeRateApiKey
        # Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL points to your Nginx (e.g., http://localhost/api for local Docker)
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost/api 
        CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost # Or your frontend's actual origin in production
        CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS_FROM_ENV_FOR_JAVA_CONFIG=${CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS}
        ```
    *   **Important:** Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and keys. `JWT_SECRET` must be strong.

3.  **Building the Backend Microservices:**
    Navigate to the `backend/` directory (where your parent `pom.xml` is located):
    ```bash
    mvn clean install -U
    ```
    To skip tests:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install -U -DskipTests
    ```

4.  **Running with Docker Compose:**
    From the `docker/` directory (where your `docker-compose.yml` is located):
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    To run in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    To stop services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    To view logs:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f <service_name> # e.g., account-service
    ```

## Running Individual Services (Optional - For Development)

1.  Start essential services via Docker Compose: `docker-compose up -d account-db exchange-db rabbitmq eureka-server nginx`.
2.  Configure your IDE to provide the necessary environment variables for the service you want to run locally.
3.  Run the Spring Boot application (e.g., `AccountServiceApplication.java`) from your IDE or using `mvn spring-boot:run` in its module directory.
4.  Run the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`.

## Key API Endpoints (via API Gateway)

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api` and routed through Nginx and then API Gateway.
(e.g., `http://localhost/api/auth/login` or `https://exchangeplatform.hacigodavutaktas.online/api/auth/login`)

### Authentication Endpoints (`/api/auth`)
*   `POST /register`: Body: `{ "username": "user", "password": "password" }`
*   `POST /login`: Body: `{ "username": "user", "password": "password" }`
*   `POST /logout`
*   `GET /check`

### Account Service Endpoints (`/api/account`)
(Requires `X-User` header, provided by API Gateway)
*   `GET /info`
*   `GET /wallet`
*   `GET /transactions?currencyType=TRY`
*   `POST /deposit`: Body: `{ "currencyType": "TRY", "amount": 100.00 }`
*   `POST /withdraw`: Body: `{ "currencyType": "USD", "amount": 50.00 }`

### Exchange Service Endpoints (`/api/exchange`)
(Requires `X-User` header, provided by API Gateway)
*   `GET /rates`
*   `GET /rates/{baseCurrency}`
*   `POST /process`: Body: `{ "fromCurrency": "USD", "toCurrency": "TRY", "fromAmount": 10.00 }`

## Accessing the Applications

*   **Frontend UI:** `http://localhost` (via Nginx) or `https://exchangeplatform.hacigodavutaktas.online`
*   **API Gateway (Direct):** `http://localhost:8090`
*   **Eureka Dashboard:** `http://localhost:8761`
*   **RabbitMQ Management:** `http://localhost:15672` (default: guest/guest)

## Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** JUnit 5 & Mockito for services, utilities in each backend module.
*   **Repository Tests (`@DataJpaTest`):** Focused tests for Spring Data JPA repositories, often using H2 or Testcontainers.
*   **Integration Tests (`@SpringBootTest`):** Test component interactions within services, using Testcontainers for PostgreSQL & RabbitMQ.
